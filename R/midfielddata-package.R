#' Sample of MIDFIELD Student Unit Record Data 
#'
#' Provides a sample of MIDFIELD data for practice working with 
#' longitudinal, de-identified, individual student unit records from 
#' multiple US institutions.
#' 
#' @section Background:
#' \href{https://engineering.purdue.edu/MIDFIELD}{MIDFIELD} (as of May 2021)
#' contains individual student record data for 1.7 M unique students at 33
#' US institutions. MIDFIELD is large enough to permit disaggregation by
#' multiple characteristics simultaneously, enabling researchers to examine
#' student characteristics (race/ethnicity, sex, prior achievement) and
#' curricular pathways (including coursework and major) by institution and
#' over time.
#' 
#' midfieldata provides a sample of these data (for practice) with 
#' longitudinal SURs for 98,000 undergraduates at 12 institutions 
#' from 1987â€“2016 organized in four data tables:
#' \itemize{
#'  \item {\href{https://midfieldr.github.io/midfielddata/reference/student.html}{student}}
#'  \item {\href{https://midfieldr.github.io/midfielddata/reference/course.html}{course}}
#'  \item {\href{https://midfieldr.github.io/midfielddata/reference/term.html}{term}}
#'  \item {\href{https://midfieldr.github.io/midfielddata/reference/degree.html}{degree}}
#' }
#' 
#' Tools to work with these data are provided in the R package 
#' \href{https://midfieldr.github.io/midfieldr/}{midfieldr}.
