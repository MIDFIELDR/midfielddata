Title: MIDFIELD Data Sample
Version: 0.2.0
Description: Provides a data sample for practice working with individual 
    undergraduate student unit records (registrar's data) in 'R'. Data are 
    organized in four data tables --- `student`, `course`, `term`, and `degree` 
    --- providing anonymized records for approximately 98,000 students at three 
    US institutions from 1988 through 2018, keyed by student ID. These data are 
    a proportionate stratified sample of the MIDFIELD database. However, unlike 
    MIDFIELD data, the data in 'midfielddata' are not suitable for drawing 
    inferences about program attributes or student experiences --- these are 
    practice data, not research data.
