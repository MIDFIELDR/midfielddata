Title: midfielddata: Sample of MIDFIELD Student Unit Record Data
Description: An 'R' data package for distributing practice Student Unit Record 
  (SUR) data and documentation. The source is the MIDFIELD database, which 
  contains (as of October, 2022) individual SUR data for 1.7M undergraduate 
  students at 19 US institutions from 1987 through 2018. 'midfielddata' 
  provides a proportionate stratified sample of MIDFIELD data: anonymized SURs 
  for approximately 98,000 students at three US institutions from 1988 through 
  2018. Data are organized in four tables: student, course, term, and degree.
