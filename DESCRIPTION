Description: Registrar's data for 98,000 undergraduates at participating 
  US institutions from 1987 to 2016. Four data tables with attributes of 
  students, terms, courses, and degrees. The data in midfielddata are a 
  proportionate stratified random sample of 12 institutions in the MIDFIELD 
  research database. However, these are practice data, not research 
  data---suitable for learning about student-record analysis, but not for 
  drawing inferences about student performance.
