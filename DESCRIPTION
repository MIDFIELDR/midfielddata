Package: midfielddata
Title: MIDFIELD Data Sample
Version: 0.2.0
Description: This data package contains anonymized student-level records for 
  98,000 undergraduates from three US institutions from 1988 through 2018 
  organized in four data tables keyed by student ID. Student-level data refers 
  to information collected by undergraduate institutions on individual students 
  including demographics, programs and academic standing by term, individual 
  courses, grades, and degrees. These data are a proportionate stratified sample 
  of the MIDFIELD database, but are not suitable for drawing inferences about 
  program attributes or student experiences---‘midfielddata’ provides practice 
  data, not research data.
