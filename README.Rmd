<br>`midfielddata` is an R data package that supplies anonymized student-level records for 98,000 undergraduates from the MIDFIELD database. Provides practice data for the tools and methods of `midfieldr`.

## Introduction

Data at the "student-level" refers to information collected by undergraduate institutions on individual students, including:   

- *course* information, e.g., course name & number, credit hours, and student grades 
- *term* information, e.g., program, academic standing, and grade point average 
- *student* demographic information, e.g., age, sex, and race/ethnicity
- *degree* information, e.g., institution, program, term, and baccalaureate degree

`midfielddata` provides anonymized student-level records for 98,000 undergraduates at three US institutions from 1988 through 2018, collected in four data tables keyed by student ID. 

```{r}
#| echo: false
wrapr::build_frame(
  "Dataset", "Each row is", "Students", "Rows", "Columns", "Memory" |
    "course", "one student per course", "97,555", "3,289,532", 12L, "324.3 MB" |
    "term", "one student per term", "97,555", "639,915", 13L, "72.8 MB" |
    "student", "one student", "97,555", "97,555", 13L, "17.3 MB" |
    "degree", "one student per degree", "49,543", "49,665", 5L, "5.2 MB"
) |>
  kableExtra::kbl(align = "llrrrr", caption = "Table 1. Practice datasets in `midfielddata`.") |>
  kableExtra::kable_paper(lightable_options = "basic", full_width = FALSE) |>
  kableExtra::row_spec(0, background = "#c7eae5") |>
  kableExtra::column_spec(1, monospace = TRUE) |>
  kableExtra::column_spec(1:6, color = "black", background = "white")
```

The data in `midfielddata` are a proportionate stratified sample of the [MIDFIELD](#more-information) database, but are *not suitable for drawing inferences* about program attributes or student experiences---`midfielddata` are for *practice*, not research. 

*Notes on syntax.* &nbsp; We use `data.table` for data manipulation. Some users may prefer base R or `dplyr`. Each system has its strengths---users are welcome to translate our examples to their preferred syntax.  

```{r}
format(Sys.Date(), "%Y-%m-%d") # Today's date
packageVersion("midfielddata") # Student-level records practice data
packageVersion("data.table") # For data manipulation
```




## Usage

*Start.* &nbsp; If you are writing your own script to follow along, we use these packages in this vignette:

```{r}
library(midfielddata)
library(data.table)
```

*Load data tables.*  &nbsp; Data tables can be loaded individually or collectively as needed.  

```{r}
# Load one table as needed
data(student)

# Or load multiple tables
data(course, term, degree)
```

We display the records for one specific student, using their ID to subset each dataset.  

```{r}
# One student ID
id_we_want <- "MCID3112192438"
```

*Student.* &nbsp; As expected, `student` yields one row per student.

```{r}
# Observations for a selected ID
student[mcid == id_we_want]
```

*Course.* &nbsp; For this student, the records span `r nrow(course[mcid == id_we_want])` rows, one row per course. 

```{r}
# Observations for a selected ID
course[mcid == id_we_want]
```

*Term.* &nbsp; Here, the records span `r nrow(term[mcid == id_we_want])` rows, one row per term. 

```{r}
# Observations for a selected ID
term[mcid == id_we_want]
```

*Degree.* &nbsp; In this example, the records span `r nrow(degree[mcid == id_we_want])` rows, one row per degree. The degrees were earned in the same term, Spring 2009. 

```{r}
# Observations for a selected ID
degree[mcid == id_we_want]
```

Not all students with more than one degree earn them in the same term. For example, the next student earned a degree in 1996 and a second degree in 1999. In most analyses, only the first baccalaureate degree would be used.

```{r}
# Observations for a different ID
degree[mcid == "MCID3111315508"]
```

```{r}
#| include: false

# Find duplicate IDs in degree
# DT <- copy(degree)
# idx <- which(duplicated(DT[, .(mcid)]))
# dup_ID <- DT[idx, .(mcid)]
# dup_degree <- dup_ID[degree, on = "mcid", nomatch = NULL]
# dup_degree
```




## Installation

Install with: 

```{r}
#| eval: false
install.packages("midfielddata",
  repos = "https://MIDFIELDR.github.io/drat/",
  type = "source"
)
``` 

The installed size of `midfielddata` is about 24 Mb, so installation will take longer than that of a conventional CRAN package. Also because of its size, the package is not hosted on CRAN (with its 5 MB size limit)---instead, we host it on the MIDFIELDR `drat` repository as indicated above. 

Link to installation instructions for `midfieldr` below.
