<br>This data package contains anonymized student-level records for 98,000 undergraduates; a practice-data sample of the MIDFIELD database. 

![](https://github.com/MIDFIELDR/midfielddata/blob/main/docs/logo.png?raw=true)




## Introduction

Student-level data refers to information collected by undergraduate institutions on individual students, including:   

- *course* information, e.g., course name & number, credit hours, and student grades 
- *term* information, e.g., program, academic standing, and grade point average 
- *student* demographic information, e.g., age, sex, and race/ethnicity
- *degree* information, e.g., institution, program, term, and baccalaureate degree


'midfielddata' provides anonymized student-level records for 98,000 undergraduates at three US institutions from 1988 through 2018, collected in four data tables keyed by student ID. 

```{r}
#| echo: false

wrapr::build_frame(
  "Practice data table", "Each row is", "No. of rows", "No. of columns", "Memory" |
    "course" , "one student per course per term", "3,289,532", "12", "324 Mb" |
    "term"   , "one student per term"           ,   "639,915", "13",  "73 Mb" |
    "student", "one degree-seeking student"     ,    "97,555", "13",  "18 Mb" |
    "degree" , "one student per degree earned"  ,    "49,543",  "5",   "5 Mb"
) |>
  kableExtra::kbl(
    align = "llrrr",
    caption = "Table 1. Practice data in 'midfielddata'."
  ) |>
  kableExtra::kable_paper(lightable_options = "basic", full_width = TRUE) |>
  kableExtra::row_spec(0, background = "#c7eae5") |>
  kableExtra::column_spec(1, monospace = TRUE) |>
  kableExtra::column_spec(1:5, color = "black", background = "white")
```


These data are a proportionate stratified sample of the [MIDFIELD database](#more-information), but are not suitable for drawing inferences about program attributes or student experiences---'midfielddata' provides practice data, not research data.

## Usage

Data tables can be loaded individually or in groups as needed.  

```{r}
#| eval: false
# Load multiple tables at once 
data(student, course, term, degree, package = "midfielddata")
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
# Load the three smaller data tables (avoiding time-consuming course)
data(student, term, degree, package = "midfielddata")
```

To illustrate the data structure, we examine the student-level data for one specific student. 

```{r}
# One student ID
mcid_we_want <- "MCID3112192438"
```



### `student` 

The `student` data table contains one observation per student. Here we select a subset of columns for a less cluttered printout. 

```{r}
# Select specific rows and columns
rows_we_want <- student$mcid == mcid_we_want
cols_we_want <- c("mcid", "institution", "transfer", "race", "sex", "age_desc")

# All observations for this ID 
df <- student[rows_we_want, cols_we_want]

# Cleanup and display
row.names(df) <- NULL
df
```




### `course`

Course data are structured in block-record form, that is, records associated with a particular ID can span multiple rows---one record per student per course per term.

For the example case, the `course` records span 47 rows. 

```{r}
#| eval: false
# Select specific rows and columns
rows_we_want <- course$mcid == mcid_we_want
cols_we_want <- c("mcid", "term_course", "course", "grade")

# All observations for this ID 
df <- course[rows_we_want, cols_we_want]

# Cleanup and display
row.names(df) <- NULL
df
#>              mcid term_course                         course grade

### `term`

Term data are also structured in block-record form---one record per student per term.

For the example case, the `term` records span 10 rows. 

```{r}
# Select specific rows and columns
rows_we_want <- term$mcid == mcid_we_want
cols_we_want <- c("mcid", "term", "cip6", "level", "standing", "gpa_cumul")

# All observations for this ID 
df <- term[rows_we_want, cols_we_want]

# Cleanup and display
row.names(df) <- NULL
df
```





### `degree`

Degree data are also structured in block-record form---one record per student per degree. Multiple degrees can occur in the same term or in different terms.

For the example case, the `degree` records indicate a double degree in Psychology and Sociology earned in the same term. 

```{r}
# Select specific rows and columns
rows_we_want <- degree$mcid == mcid_we_want
cols_we_want <- c("mcid", "term_degree", "cip6", "degree")

# All observations for this ID 
df <- degree[rows_we_want, cols_we_want]

# Cleanup and display
row.names(df) <- NULL
df
```

Not all students with more than one degree earn them in the same term. For example, the next student earned a degree in Biological Sciences in 1996 and a second baccalaureate degree in Animal Biology in 1999. In most analyses, only the first baccalaureate degree would be used. 

```{r}
# Select specific rows and columns
rows_we_want <- degree$mcid == "MCID3111315508"
cols_we_want <- c("mcid", "term_degree", "cip6", "degree")

# All observations for this ID 
df <- degree[rows_we_want, cols_we_want]

# Cleanup and display
row.names(df) <- NULL
df
```

```{r}
#| include: false

# Find duplicate IDs in degree
# DT <- copy(degree)
# idx <- which(duplicated(DT[, .(mcid)]))
# dup_ID <- DT[idx, .(mcid)]
# dup_degree <- dup_ID[degree, on = "mcid", nomatch = NULL]
# dup_degree
```




## Installation

Install with: 

```{r}
#| eval: false
install.packages("midfielddata",
  repos = "https://MIDFIELDR.github.io/drat/",
  type = "source"
)
``` 

The installed size of 'midfielddata' is about 24 Mb, which has two consequences. First, the installation takes some time. Second, we host the package on the  [MIDFIELD 'drat' repository](https://github.com/MIDFIELDR/drat) instead of CRAN because 24 Mb exceeds the CRAN package limit (5 Mb). 


## More information

['midfieldr'](https://midfieldr.github.io/midfieldr/)

: A companion 'R' package that provides tools and detailed procedures for working with MIDFIELD data. 

[MIDFIELD](https://midfield.online/)

: The MIDFIELD database contains, as of October 2022, individual student-level data for 1.7M undergraduates at 19 US institutions from 1987 through 2018. Access to the MIDFIELD research database is currently limited to MIDFIELD partner institutions, but 'midfielddata' provides a sample of MIDFIELD data.
