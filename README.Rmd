<br>This package contains a practice-data sample of the MIDFIELD database that provides anonymized student-level records for 98,000 undergraduates.  

![](https://github.com/MIDFIELDR/midfielddata/blob/main/docs/logo.png?raw=true)




## Introduction

Student-level data refers to information collected by undergraduate institutions on individual students, including:   

- *course* information, e.g., course name & number, credit hours, and student grades 
- *term* information, e.g., program, academic standing, and grade point average 
- *student* demographic information, e.g., age, sex, and race/ethnicity
- *degree* information, e.g., institution, program, term, and baccalaureate degree


'midfielddata' provides anonymized student-level records for 98,000 undergraduates at three US institutions from 1988 through 2018, collected in four data tables keyed by student ID. 

```{r}
#| echo: false

wrapr::build_frame(
  "Practice data table", "Each row is", "No. of rows", "No. of columns", "Memory" |
    "course" , "one student per course per term", "3,289,532", "12", "324 Mb" |
    "term"   , "one student per term"           ,   "639,915", "13",  "73 Mb" |
    "student", "one degree-seeking student"     ,    "97,555", "13",  "18 Mb" |
    "degree" , "one student per degree earned"  ,    "49,543",  "5",   "5 Mb"
) |>
  kableExtra::kbl(
    align = "llrrr",
    caption = "Table 1. Practice data in 'midfielddata'."
  ) |>
  kableExtra::kable_paper(lightable_options = "basic", full_width = TRUE) |>
  kableExtra::row_spec(0, background = "#c7eae5") |>
  kableExtra::column_spec(1, monospace = TRUE) |>
  kableExtra::column_spec(1:5, color = "black", background = "white")
```


These data are a proportionate stratified sample of the [MIDFIELD database](#more-information), but are not suitable for drawing inferences about program attributes or student experiences---'midfielddata' provides practice data, not research data.

## Usage

We use 'data.table' throughout for its compact syntax. Its use is optional, though one would have to modify the examples to accommodate a different data manipulation syntax such as that in base 'R' or 'dplyr'.

```{r}
# For data manipulation
library(data.table)
```

Data tables can be loaded individually or in groups as needed.  

```{r}
#| eval: false
# Load multiple tables at once 
data(student, course, term, degree, package = "midfielddata")
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
# Load the three smaller data tables (avoiding time-consuming course)
data(student, term, degree, package = "midfielddata")
```

To illustrate the data structure, we examine the student-level data for one specific student. 

```{r}
# One student ID
mcid_we_want <- "MCID3112192438"
```



### `student` 

The `student` data table contains one observation per student. Here we select a subset of columns for a less cluttered printout. 

```{r}
# Select specific columns
cols_we_want <- c("mcid", "institution", "transfer", "race", "sex", "age_desc")

# All observations for this ID 
student[mcid == mcid_we_want, .SD, .SDcols = cols_we_want]
```


### `course`

The remaining excerpts illustrate the block-record structure of the data, that is, information for one student forms a block of rows, all with the same ID. 

The `course` information for this student, for example, contains 47 rows---one observation per course per term---from Fall 2005 through Spring 2009. 

```{r}
#| eval: false
# Select specific columns
cols_we_want <- c("mcid", "term_course", "course", "grade")

# All observations for this ID 
course[mcid == mcid_we_want, .SD, .SDcols = cols_we_want]
#>               mcid term_course                         course  grade

```




### `term`

The `term` data table has one observation per student per term. This student enrolled for 10 consecutive terms, changing majors once (row 2, `cip6` variable) and then changing back. 

```{r}
# Select specific columns
cols_we_want <- c("mcid", "term", "cip6", "level", "standing", "gpa_cumul")

# All observations for this ID 
term[mcid == mcid_we_want, .SD, .SDcols = cols_we_want]
```


### `degree`

The `degree` data table has one observation per student per degree. This student earned a double degree in Psychology and Sociology, thus there are two observations for this ID. 

```{r}
# Select specific columns 
cols_we_want <- c("mcid", "term_degree", "cip6", "degree")

# All observations for this ID 
degree[mcid == mcid_we_want, .SD, .SDcols = cols_we_want]
```

Not all students with more than one degree earn them in the same term. For example, the next student earned a degree in Biological Sciences in 1996 and a second baccalaureate degree in Animal Biology in 1999. In most analyses, only the first baccalaureate degree would be used. 

```{r}
# All observations for this ID 
degree[mcid == "MCID3111315508", .SD, .SDcols = cols_we_want]
```

```{r}
#| include: false

# Find duplicate IDs in degree
# DT <- copy(degree)
# idx <- which(duplicated(DT[, .(mcid)]))
# dup_ID <- DT[idx, .(mcid)]
# dup_degree <- dup_ID[degree, on = "mcid", nomatch = NULL]
# dup_degree
```




## Installation

The installed size of 'midfielddata' is about 24 Mb. Because this exceeds the CRAN package limit (5 Mb), we host the package on the  [MIDFIELD 'drat' repository](https://github.com/MIDFIELDR/drat).  

Also because of its size, the installation takes some time. Install with: 

```{r}
#| eval: false

install.packages("midfielddata",
  repos = "https://MIDFIELDR.github.io/drat/",
  type = "source"
)
``` 




## More information

[MIDFIELD database](https://midfield.online/)

: MIDFIELD contains, as of October 2022, individual student-level data for 1.7M undergraduates at 19 US institutions from 1987 through 2018. Access to the MIDFIELD research database is currently limited to MIDFIELD partner institutions, but a sample of these data are available in 'midfielddata'.  

['midfieldr'](https://midfieldr.github.io/midfieldr/)

: A companion 'R' package that provides tools and detailed procedures for working with MIDFIELD data.
